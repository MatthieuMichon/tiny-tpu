# TODOs:
- Go through entire workflow to understand it fully
- Xander will explain how accumulator module works
- Optimize and refactor code (ex: refactoring if else statements to FSMs)
- Test forward pass w integers to see if there’s a structure error or if its due to precision
- If there’s a structure issue, figure out how to turn off PEs
- Change fp precision to 32-bit
- Look into how to do batch inference (we have single input inference working)
